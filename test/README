Run tests with::

  $ ./test/test.py

… from the root of the project.

Which looks for any ``*/feed.*`` files and processes them using each
``*.config`` file in the feed's directory.  The output messages are
saved (not mailed) and compared with the expected output for that
feed/config pair.  For example, with a directory structure like::

  test
  |-- README
  |-- allthingsrss
  |   |-- 1.config
  |   |-- 1.expected
  |   |-- 2.config
  |   |-- 2.expected
  |   `-- feed.atom
  |-- otherfeed
  |   |-- a.config
  |   |-- a.expected
  |   |-- b.config
  |   |-- b.expected
  |   `-- feed.rss
  `-- test.py

``test.py`` will parse:

* ``feed.atom`` after loading ``1.config`` and compare the output with
  ``1.expected``.
* ``feed.atom`` after loading ``2.config`` and compare the output with
  ``2.expected``.
* ``feed.rss`` after loading ``a.config`` and compare the output with
  ``a.expected``.
* ``feed.rss`` after loading ``b.config`` and compare the output with
  ``b.expected``.

Various other tests are also run, run test.py with the '-v' option to
see exactly which tests are being run:

  $ ./test/test.py -v

If you want to test an r2e script not in the repo (e.g. the system
one), you can provide the environment variable R2E_PATH, with the
absolute path to the script that you want to test. We use this in our
CI build:

  $ R2E_PATH=/path/to/your/r2e ./test/test.py -v
