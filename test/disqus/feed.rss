What we *do* know is that for their younger-by-five-years selves, the visual feedback of programming with images makes a difference: for example, being able to see that you've colored the top half of the image red instead of the top-left triangle is a powerful aid to debugging, and more visceral than the equivalent text output. But I agree, manipulating text (particularly reading and analyzing data files) is an important hook too...&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Greg Wilson</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 17 Nov 2012 14:01:27 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: Who Wants To Write a Little Code?</title><link>http://software-carpentry.org/2012/11/who-wants-to-write-a-little-code/#comment-713578641</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This and previous discussions of the empirical results on learning outcomes have left me wondering in how far this depends on students demographics. I can see that "media work best" is true for undergrads and high school students, but it seems to me that for (post-) PhD's the important metric would be closeness of the material to the area in which they will apply things. Has there been a study on the SWC target crowd that I have missed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of myself, I have never needed to manipulate an image while I am doing some form of data munging all the time. Had the SWC material been presented primarily in terms of image manipulation, most likely I would not have given it a second, deeper look.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Hans-Martin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 17 Nov 2012 11:21:26 -0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
