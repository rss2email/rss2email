This and previous discussions of the empirical results on learning outcomes
have left me wondering in how far this depends on students demographics. I can
see that "media work best" is true for undergrads and high school students,
but it seems to me that for (post-) PhD's the important metric would be
closeness of the material to the area in which they will apply things. Has
there been a study on the SWC target crowd that I have missed?

Speaking of myself, I have never needed to manipulate an image while I am
doing some form of data munging all the time. Had the SWC material been
presented primarily in terms of image manipulation, most likely I would not
have given it a second, deeper look.

@Hans-Martin  
That's a really good point: no, we don't have anything that specifically
studies our target cohort. What we *do* know is that for their younger-by-
five-years selves, the visual feedback of programming with images makes a
difference: for example, being able to see that you've colored the top half of
the image red instead of the top-left triangle is a powerful aid to debugging,
and more visceral than the equivalent text output. But I agree, manipulating
text (particularly reading and analyzing data files) is an important hook
too...
